### Notes

* For divs class="requirement [*status here*]"
    * [*status here*] can be:
        * **Status_NONE**: I'm assuming this means that it's not actually a requirement and it just is there so the styling of the page stays the same since the styling is from 20+ years ago.
        * **STATUS_OK**: Means the requirement is already done.
        * **STATUS_NO**: Means the requirement is somehow not fulfilled yet. ***This is what we want***

### TODO / REMEMBER:
- [ ] Make a special requirement for requirements that only have text and no actual class options under the requirement. For instance, the GWAR requirement just says to "Check the University Catalog." This must be accounted for -- even beyond the GWAR and just implemented as a broad feature.
